 <p class="side">Established around the early 1990s (our good-for-nothing founder doesn't remember), we've been committed to provide the world with top notch solutions for their complex problems. Despite the name, we don't only handle demons! We are one emergency away from going bankrupt, and therefore very open to whatever you throw at us! </p>
<p class="side" >Due to the current situation in Redgrave city, (aka, a new king of hell springing up in the middle of the city), our service booking is on hold! Worry not, we will be back as soon as we defeat him and the city isn't overtaken by demons. Thank you for your patronage! </p>
